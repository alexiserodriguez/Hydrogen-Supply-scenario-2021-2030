# Hydrogen Supply scenario 2021 2030 Analysis and Tableau Dashboard
In this project, an analysis with SQL Server and visualization dashboard with Tableau Public were done from the Hydrogen Projects Database. The dataset was collected from <a href='https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/hydrogen-projects-database'>International Energy Association</a> and cleaned with SQL Server and Excel. The main objective from this analysis was to analyze the hydrogen  supply scenario from 2021 to 2030 as Hydrogen will represent one of the most valuable assets in the energy industry in the near future. The following repository includes files and scripts from the Data Analysis done with SQL Server and Excel.
